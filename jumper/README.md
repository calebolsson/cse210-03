# Jumper
Do you have what it takes? Will you risk it all? <i>Jumper</i> is a new take on a traditional word guessing
game. The rules are simple. The player tries to guess the computer's randomly selected word before their
parachute gets cut. The player can guess letters until they guess the word or run out of guesses!

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
